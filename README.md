# SimpleSiteDesign

#My idea with this simple site is to explore things that I've been learning and improve my abilities. With other future projects I going to do more complex things, little by little.

#Here I use just HTML and CSS (with flexbox), I found some challenges to do the design, and the next I'll use Grid instead Flexbox.
